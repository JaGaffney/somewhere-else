GENERAL
# focus on progression over everything else
# each skill has an "arcana" card that you can use for benefits (could run out of charges) this could be the talent tree system
    but tied to each skill
# you can do all combat styles but you could have like a tierd unlock system at teh start but once you unlock mage yuo can just do it
    as long as you have the mats or skill



SKILLS
#   skills a broken down into 2 caterogys but have the 1 skills exp, helps trim down shit skills but still
    makes them worthwhile to level
    woodcutting has 
        gathering - getting wood
        crafting - fletching bows arrows etc

#   skills have direct effect into combat
        kind of like melvor mastery but you have to decide
            woodcutting could have stuff like  
                increased range dmg due to making better bows
                gather wood faster
                wood burns longer etc
                even direct spells like wood style jutsu stuff like entangle or slows

#   the "arcana" thing would be another exp tied to the skill
        when you fish with the leveling arcana bit you dont get fish but arana increases in level
        you get faster exp to level arcana if you have the skil lhigher level than it but you dont have to
        the benefit of leveling the main skill is to keep the drops as well as unlock new tiers of exp

COMAT
#   has melee, range, magic which could have sub categorys or just have the option of swtiching gear
#   you use the arcanas in combat either for buffs or direct damage
#   combat is more action based by requiring you use skills, you cna also afk it but it would be slower and not work out for high
    level monster or areas


OTHER
#   no need to have cloud system just save everything local, can even make it desktop
#   world map that takes you to new areas that costs resources early on but later on you can even make money traeveling
        such as if your have high melee you can be a guards
        mages can teleport
        rangers can travese the wilderness
#   could have mini events every few hours that increase exp in certain skills so if you are playing you get a benefit but only minor 
    so not forced to keep playing
